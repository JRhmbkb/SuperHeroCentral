# cis5500-MarvelProject

Setting up your machine to build our project:

As with HW #2, in order to run our application you will need the latest version of Node.js on your machine. 

You can verify this by running the following commands: 

npm -v
node -v 

We recommend Node version 14.17.x, where x can be any number (slightly older/newer versions of node should probably work as well). If you 
are using an older Node version and have problems, please update Node. 

Instructions for building our project locally: 

To start, unzip our Project folder and open it in VSCode, or your code editor of choice. 

From there, open up a new terminal.

cd into the server folder, and then run npm install: 

cd server
npm install 

Next, open up another terminal in order to do the same process for the client folder. 

From your new terminal, cd into the client folder, and run npm install:

cd client
npm install 

Now you are ready to run our project locally! 

Return to the first terminal, and from server, run the following command to start the backend: 

npm start 

Once the backend has been started, return to the second terminal instance, and from the client, run the same command to start the frontend:

npm start 

Congratulations, you are now running our project application locally!
